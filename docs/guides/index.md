# Welcome

This guide was originally written by ajchimaera on the 18th of January 2022.

I (Clubwho) have rewritten this as a [dog food test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) for Speedrun-Docs and as a way to learn the speedrun for an [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) run with friends. This has no affiliation with any Subnautica community.

## Setup

### Scroll wheel

You may notice watching other runs that we break materials a lot faster than normal. That's
because we bind the scroll wheel to the left and right-click actions. So a single scroll down gives
multiple of that input. That allows us to scroll when breaking a rock, giving the 4 required clicks in
one motion.

This also allows us to transfer items between inventories a lot faster. When you regularly move an
item between lockers, all the items are shifted up so the empty space is at the end. This means
that you can simply scroll over a spot in an inventory to transfer it and as many items after it
really quickly.

**[Insert screenshot of keybinds.]**

### Downpatching

Some of the parts of this run require you to be on an older patch.
I will provide alternative strats, and playing on current patch loses about 40 seconds.
Here is a very useful video by Rubiks37 explaining the most up to date method for downpatching:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0, marginBottom: 16 }}>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute" }}
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-LFIq6-iDI?si=XGF4cF8QP9RCGHk4"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>
