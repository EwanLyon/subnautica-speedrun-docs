# Flare Storage + Sandstone Loop 2

During this section, you will need to use a glitch called flare storage, so I will explain it before I go through the actual route.

## Flare Storage

Flare storage is quite similar to ghost storage, in that we're overlaying animations in order to access a locker elsewhere. The difference is that we can use flare storage on any locker, including the ones in our base.

To do it is very simple:

First, take a flare out in your hand. Then, right-click to start the flare animation, and left-click on the locker.

You won't see the locker open, but if done correctly the next time you open your PDA you should have access to that locker.

This works in the same way as ghost storage, once you open your PDA and access it once, after closing your PDA you will no longer have access to flare storage, and will have to do the glitch again.

## Route

Return to your base, and craft one fibre mesh, one silicone rubber, and two lube to make inventory space. Take out 2 glass and a silver, and take off your O2 tank. Craft the metal into titanium, then make a high capacity O2 tank. Then dump all your resources into the right locker.

I would recommend also crafting all the salvages you have into titanium here - while not necessary, it can lead to power problems later if you don't and are unlucky.

Grab a flare from your locker (if you don't have one on you already), and count how much copper you have left in your locker - remember this number.

Now activate flare storage on the left locker, which should be empty currently, and leave the base. It's time for the final sandstone loop.

Glide over to the geyser (to the right of the seaglide wreck), and start collecting limestone and sandstone. You want to leave the geyser with a total of 10 copper, including the ones you counted earlier, so start your count there. If you have any quartz you still need, get it here.

Collect the 8 sandstone in the guaranteed spawns around the middle layer of the geyser.

Now you need to start counting sandstone as well. Start your count at 0 + any extra you collected outside of the 6 you collected in the low ceiling cave loop and the 2 from the other caves, and start collecting the random sandstone spawns. You will need a total of 24 sandstone + enough to get an extra gold, but you can get more in another cave in a second, so don't worry if you leave the geyser area with less. Once you've reached 10 copper, you can stop collecting limestone. Once you've got what you can from the walls around the centre, go off to the side cave with the stingers in them. You can't be hurt by them with SSG so don't worry about that. Directly in front of you, below some stingers are about 5 guaranteed sandstone.

At some point in this cave, you will likely fill your storage. When this happens, open your PDA, and dump all your copper (you can double-check your count here), all your lead, silver, gold and all your titanium except 2 (If you already have got all MVB fragments, you can dump the two titanium). Close your PDA, and continue collecting/counting. Once you've got all you can from the geyser cave, head up out the end, and over/round to the left. You can follow along/over a ridge, and you will see a pillar with red grass on it, in part of the red grass biome that's almost jutting into the kelp forest.

There may be sandstone on the pillar, but if not, there's will be in the cave beside it your about to go in.

Go into the cave next to the pillar. It's very easy to spot, and it goes under the kelp forest. Continue collecting your sandstone. Once your count reaches 24, you need to keep breaking sandstone until you get a gold. It might confuse you during crafting if you have extra sandstone materials here, so there's certainly some validity in remembering the extra you get (aside from the gold) and dropping them. You could also just not pick them up at all if they aren't gold. Once you've either got all your sandstone or can't find any more in that cave, continue out and round to the left.

[Insert video or clip or whatever]

You will see a small wreck and the entrance to a small cave beside it. This is why we kept the two titanium. Make a compartment that sticks halfway into the wreck. Once you finish it, the walls of the wreck will disappear, and there will be MVB fragments inside, hopefully enough to unlock the blueprint. If necessary, you can keep searching the kelp forest.

If you still need sandstone, you can go into that cave to the right of that wreck, where there are 6 guaranteed sandstone spawns, plus some extra random ones.

If you still haven't got all 9 metal salvage, now's your chance to grab the rest on the swim back to your base.

## Crafting

You don't have to do the inventory/locker management exactly as I explain - I've simply chosen the simplest way to do this section. With practice, you can definitely do this section faster/more efficiently.

If you have not already finished the second fabricator, pick up a table coral and finish it. Then, follow the next steps to make all the necessary items, alternating between fabricators to craft at double the speed.

Collect your metal salvage and craft it into titanium. You'll then need to create 3 titanium ingots (one ingot is 10 titanium). These ingots/titanium are something you could make during earlier crafting sections too, but if you're starting, I'd recommend doing them all now for simplicity sake, and so you don't confuse your count.

Collect all the copper, all but one of the table coral, and four gold from the lockers. Craft 5 copper wire, then 4 computer chips.

Put them in the right locker, and take out the fiber mesh and 8 silver.

Craft 4 wiring kits, and with one of them, craft a rebreather. Put one of the remaining 3 wiring kits in the right locker, and take out two computer chips and 4 gold.

With those, craft two advanced wiring kits and put them in the right locker.

Once you've made the ingots, open the right locker and dump 2 ingots. Take out 2 batteries, one lube and one silicone rubber as well.

Before you craft anything, change out the two batteries for the ones in your seaglide and habitat builder, so they are both full.

You can do some quick locker management here - clear out the left locker and put everything you can fit in the right (except the 2 ingots, 2 batteries, lube and rubber you just took out, and the tools + flare). Get SSG, any medkits you want (if you're not confident with aurora strats yet), and start crafting the MVB.

Leave your base while the MVB is crafting.

You're done with by far the worst part of the run
