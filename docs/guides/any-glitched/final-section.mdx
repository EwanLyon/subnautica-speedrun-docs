# Final Section

You'll respawn back at your base, and it's time to do the final crafting section and build the rocket.

## Dupe

Firstly, dump all almost all your stuff in the left locker and grab the metal salvage you put in flare storage. Make the salvage into 4 titanium, and while it's crafting open the right locker, and grab the following: 2 Lead (If you dropped the 2 you had in the lava zone), 1 Glass, 1 Copper wire and 2 Computer Chips. Deposit all Sulfur, Kyanite, Ion Cubes and Nickel in the right locker.

Now head out of the base, and get a reasonable distance away. Build two "I" compartments side by side, then partially build a window on the left one. Deconstruct the left compartment fully, then build an L compartment where the previous one was. Complete the window, then fully deconstruct it.

While doing this, you may encounter a situation where you created the dupe base correctly, but the moonpool is completely deconstructing without leaving a dupe behind. This will be because the moonpool is on the wrong side of the curved part of the dupe base - the side opposite the original tube.

You can see here where AJ discovered/figured this out:

Build a moonpool next to this base and dupe it. Deconstruct it fully, then deconstruct and reconstruct (by like 1%/1 click) the one left behind. Then deconstruct the new one fully and repeat. In total, you need to deconstruct 4 moonpools fully, and then deconstruct the last moonpool, till you get one titanium ingot. You should have 9 titanium ingots total in your inventory.

Finding the right spot to deconstruct the dupe moonpool is not very consistent - it's basically just a matter of guessing the right spot till you get it. Once you've finished duping, drop 3 lead and 3 lube.

## Stage 1

Find your MVB from earlier - it will have floated to the surface while you were else where and the map wasn't rendered. It should be very close by.

Depending on which spawn you're at (Clip A or Clip C), you will need to deploy the MVB in two different locations.

For Clip A, this is where you should do it:

And for Clip C, this is the lineup:

[Insert my own video recorded at day time to make clear.]

Construct the neptune rocket platform, and then return to the base.

Collect all lithium, all gold, all enamelled glass, 1 tooth and 1 advanced wiring kit from your lockers. Now make 6 Plasteel ingots, but leave the base before picking up the last 2.

## Stage 2/Cyclops

Swim back to your MVB and pick it up and wait for the Platform to drop.

Dolphin Dive onto the platform. Construct the gantry, and get off the platform.

Now redeploy the MVB so that the cyclops will spawn slightly over the side of the platform with the screen on it. The MVB will be aligned so that if you were to make a line out from the front of the MVB, it would cut off the corner.

Make the cyclops, and return back to your base. Pick up the two Plasteel you left there, and make the final Plasteel and the final Enamelled Glass.

While those are crafting, pick up all the Rubies, Gel Sacs and Deep shrooms from the left locker. Make 2 Aerogel.

While those are crafting, pick up all the Silver, Kyanite, Ion Cubes and Nickel from your lockers. Make 2 Ion Batteries, and exit your base before they finish crafting.

## Stage 3

Swim back over to the platform and wait for the Cyclops to land on it, and push the platform underwater.

Start the construction of the first rocket section, and then return to your base.

Collect the batteries you left crafting, and make the remaining two Ion Batteries.

While those are crafting, pick up all the Sulfur and Silicone Rubber. Make 2 Ion Power Cells.

While those are crafting, pick up the salt and make hydrochloric acid.

If you only dumped 3 gold in your flare storage at the mountains, deconstruct the second fabricator until you get a gold from it.

Make a polyaniline, and leave your base while it's crafting. You can collect it from the outside by pressing up against the wall with the fabricators on it.

## Stage 4

Swim back over to the platform and start the second rocket section.

Now enter the Cyclops (using Tehx clip if you want), and climb the ladder. Run into the left side of the back of the Cyclops, where you will see 3 Power Cells and fabricator on the wall.

Remove one of the Power Cells and make the Cyclops Shield Generator using the fabricator. You can get the shield gen anywhere on the cyclops so just immediately start leaving once you start the crafting of it.

Leave the Cyclops and start the final rocket section.

Swim/Run around on to the elevator on the gantry, and press the button on the left hand side of it to start it moving up. Enter the rocket, and you will see three different levers on the walls.

You should flare skip all three of them, by using the flare and immediately interacting with the lever.

[Insert video of flare skip maybe idk]

Actually getting these flare skips down smoothly can be a bit of challenge.

You should start by making sure the flare that hasn't been uncapped yet is the one you have in your hot bar, since that is the one you want to dispose of first. You will need to slow down to take out the second one after flare skipping the first lever, but letting go of sprint and pressing 5 can be done very quickly.

Then after skipping the second lever all you need to do is look straight ahead and scroll - if you're fast enough the flare won't have actually been "thrown" until after you skip the second lever and you can pick it up mid-air when it appears in front of you.

After that you don't need to slow down to take the flare back out again and you can simply skip the last lever.

The flare skips themselves don't take a lot to execute correctly, all you need to do is right click then left click back to back and it is skipped, meaning as long as your aim is good while sprinting, you never need to stop to skip it.

Eventually you'll get the 3 consecutive skips down to a fluid-like motion and will basically not have to slow down at all during this part.

Now climb the ladder, and interact with the left and right consoles. The time capsule is the one in the middle, but it isn't necessary to complete the run.

Turn around, and click on the chair as soon as it's available.

End timer.
