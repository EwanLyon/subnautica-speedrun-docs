# Spawn + Scanner

## Scanner
The first thing you want to do is grab the medkit and leave through the hatch. Once you've left, if
you have a spawn outlined by the previous section, you can continue. Note whether your spawn is
Clip A or Clip C - this is very important to remember.

Firstly, grab two limestone and 6 acid mushrooms. The first two limestone are always one
titanium and one copper. If you see a metal salvage, get that as well, as it will let you also make an
O2 tank. If you get the salvage (remember to count it), and your first limestone is copper, you
don't need to grab a second one.

Return back to the lifepod, and craft the following: 1 battery, and then the scanner.

If you get a metal salvage, in addition to the battery and scanner, make the salvage into titanium
and the titanium into the O2 tank, but be sure to make the O2 tank last and activate ghost storage
and leave immediately as you don't want to collect it until after the seaglide deathloop.

## Coral tube + seaglide fragments

The first thing to do in this section is activate a glitch called Ghost Storage.

### Ghost Storage

Ghost storage is quite an easy glitch to do. Simply click the locker in the lifepod, and immediately
click the hatch to exit. You can also scroll while moving your mouse from the lifepod to the hatch,
effectively doing the same thing, but maybe a bit easier. This overrides the animation where you
actually open your PDA to access the storage with the animation to leave the lifepod. This leaves
your PDA in a state where it has access to the lifepod storage. This lets us effectively access our
lifepod storage from anywhere on the map, with the caveat that after you open your PDA and
close it again, ghost storage is lost. This means that when you have ghost storage enabled you
should be careful to not accidentally open your PDA before you need to.

You can see L30nh4rd explain/demonstrate ghost storage at the linked timestamp in his video.

## Route

So, first, activate ghost storage and swim to the large entrance of the coral tube (not the side that leads to the kelp forest), making sure to get full air. Swimming on top of the water is about 33% faster than swimming underwater when you don'â€™'t have the seaglide, so on your way to the coral tube stick to the surface.

You'll have space to grab 22 items + 2 creepvine seeds, which you will dump in the ghost storage before scanning the seaglide and dying.

Go into the coral tube, and collect all the quartz and limestone you can off the sides, preferably swimming in a helix-like" motion to cover the maximum surface area. Once you're out, fill your air, then swim through the forest,  two creepvine seeds on the way through. As you're leaving the kelp forest, open your PDA and dump everything you grabbed (2 creepvine seeds and all the titanium, copper and quartz you can fit) into ghost storage. With ghost storage open, you should grab and eat the all of the nutrient blocks and waters to save space. If you're a newer runner, you may want to keep them in case your food/water gets low, but you won't be able to fit all 22 items then.

Scan two seaglide fragments at the wreck, and wait to drown. There's a chance there won't be two seaglide fragments at this wreck. You can try to find one in the kelp forest before you drown, and if you're not too worried about getting a fast time yet, there is always a guaranteed Seaglide at Lifepod 3 (you can get some air and get the seaglide and then drown).

When dying in Subnautica, you get to keep one random item you picked up after leaving your base - so you can grab a metal salvage before dying and still keep it. Remember to add this metal salvage to your count.

Respawn at lifepod.

If you have a spawn that's closer to the seaglide wreck than the coral tube entrance, it's faster to do the wreck first and drown at the end of the coral tube (just the same route in reverse).
