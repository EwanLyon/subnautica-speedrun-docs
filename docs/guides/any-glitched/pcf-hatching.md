# PCF + hatching

## Sea crown + Ion cube

Swim back in bounds by the Ion cube, and pick it up. Slash the sea crown, and then turn around and head out of the cave.

## [Insert clip or video of leaving cave.]

Hatching blueprint

Once you've left the cave, turn right and head over the platform with the eggs on it. Place the ion cube on it, this will start the voice lines to get you the hatching enzyme blueprint, but you can leave the PCF while that's happening. So turn around, and swim over the portal.

## Portal + Hatching Enzymes + return (RIP KrazeyCane)

As you have SSG, you can clip through the sand in front of the portal enough to interact with the pedestal before the sand is blown away. To do this, simply swim full speed at the pile of sand in front of it, and click the pedestal during the moment your head slightly clips through. This will activate the portal, and allow you to go through.

On the other side of the portal, you'll be back at your mountain base. Deconstruct the half-built compartment to get your titanium back. Enter the base, build a fabricator and craft a hatching enzyme. Deconstruct the fabricator, leave the base and deconstruct the hatch. Now head back through the portal to the PCF.

To get the right amount of oxygen, open your PDA as you enter the portal. This will let you use it while you load. Take off your oxygen tank. This should hopefully work out so that you have about 21 O2 left after cure clip, but if something goes wrong and your O2 starts getting close to 0 earlier than that, you can put the tank back on.

After taking off your tank, also drop the Quartz and Table Coral you have - you don't need them anymore.

Once you're back through the portal, swim over to the platform with the eggs, and click on where it asks for the enzymes. Turn around and go back out of the portal.
